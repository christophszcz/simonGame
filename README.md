This is a replica Simon game that was built using vanilla JavaScript. Some notable features include strict mode where a user who gets a button press wrong is notified and the entire game restarts with a new random series of button presses. In addition, you can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct, as a result a victory tone is played.
